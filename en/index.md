## Introduction

Professor Carla Sieburgh is an independent legal expert with expertise in
private law and in the effects of EU law, human rights law and public law on
national private law. She works in both national and international contexts and
is known for her lucid analysis, innovative thinking and cheerful, constructive
cooperation. Evidently, the facts of the case at hand always serve as the point
of departure. As the author of the four volumes on the Dutch law of obligations
in the authoritative Asser-series she has a profound knowledge of the texture
and details of Dutch patrimonial law and the connections between its legal
doctrines. As a former Justice in the Dutch Supreme Court (private law division)
and as a former State Councillor in the Dutch Council of State (administrative
jurisdiction division) she has extensive experience in dispute resolution and
independent legal advice.
